# Sporefall

A 2D Action Platformer with Survival Horror and Shooter elements set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by mutated fungi and zombie-like creatures called spores.

Game I made for our course GameDev. Not much in here.

## Quick Gameplay Details
  * Shoot and swing left to right
  * If on air, may deal critical damage
  * Only have five (5) stages
  * Bit of parkour
  * Spores (zombies) spawn in specific places but each of their attributes are randomized in three classes: Small, Average, Large
  * And a boss fight where the boss is just a buffed version of the spores.
