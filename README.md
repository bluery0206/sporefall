# Sporefall

A Mobile 2D Action Platformer with Survival Horror and Shooter elements set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by mutated fungi and zombie-like creatures called spores.

Learning Godot for a school project and this is my first game that is actually playable, featuring basic gameplay mechanics, and five levels each with varying difficulties.

Kinda not so confident as juniors, classmates, and other programmers my age can do better but still proud of this creation.

## Quick Gameplay Details
  * Move left and right,
  * Shoot and swing left or right to kill the Spores (zombies),
  * If on air, may deal critical damage to enemies,
  * Bit of parkour elements,
  * Spores spawn in specific places but each of their attributes are randomized in three classes: Small, Average, Large.
  * And a boss fight where the boss is a buffed version of the spores.
